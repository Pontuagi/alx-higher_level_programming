    • 0-positive_or_negative.py - a program that will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code {https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/e4tR3cjFHqhelf4y485-zQ} in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
    • 1-last_digit.py - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code [https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Vku0ZPFeDPuXUKD8nZ4mOQ] in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
    • 2-print_alphabet.py - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
    • 3-print_alphabt.py - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. Print all the letters except q and e
    • 4-print_hexa.py -  a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal 
    • 5-print_comb2.py - a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
        ◦ Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
        ◦ Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
    • 6-print_comb3.py -  a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
    • 7-islower.py - a function that checks for lowercase character.
    • 8-uppercase.py - a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
    • 9-print_last_digit.py - a function that prints the last digit of a number.
    • 10-add.py - a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
    • 11-pow.py -  a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
    • 12-fizzbuzz.py - a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
    • 13-insert_number.c, lists.h - a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
        ◦ Prototype: listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);
        ◦ Return: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed
    • 100-print_tebahpla.py -  a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
    • 101-remove_char_at.py -  a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
    • 102-magic_calculation.py – a Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode
